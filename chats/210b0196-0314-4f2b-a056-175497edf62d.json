The dish is ready when the spinach is wilted and cooked to preference.\n\nThe dish is a simple spaghetti recipe for two, featuring a sauce made with anchovies, garlic, jalapeno pepper, parmesan cheese, and olive oil, finished with parsley.\n 1: Cook half a pound of spaghetti in boiling water until it reaches the desired doneness, typically between 11 to 15 minutes.\n 2: Extend the pasta in the boiling water to ensure it melts evenly.\n 3: Prepare the sauce by adding oil from a container of anchovies into a bowl.\n 4: Chop the anchovies and crush three cloves of garlic, then combine them with the oil.\n 5: Slice half of a jalapeno pepper and add it to the sauce mixture.\n 6: Incorporate a couple of tablespoons of parmesan cheese and two tablespoons of olive oil into the sauce.\n 7: Heat the sauce in the microwave for about one to one and a half minutes to cook the garlic.\n 8: Drain the cooked pasta, reserving half a cup of the pasta water.

Cover and continue boiling until the pasta is cooked, about 20 minutes.\n 9: Once the pasta is cooked, enrich the dish with a tablespoon or so of butter and a couple of tablespoons of chives or parsley.\n 10: Bring the dish back to a boil, check for seasoning, and adjust with more salt and pepper if needed.\n 11: Serve the pasta vasoule with Parmesan cheese on top and maybe a little extra green for garnish.\n\n\n    \nYou will generate a recpie with the steps in the style of the given recipes.
