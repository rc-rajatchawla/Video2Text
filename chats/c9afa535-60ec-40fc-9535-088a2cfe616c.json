It can be enhanced with chives and cheese for additional flavor.\n 1: Prepare a stock or have it ready. Jacques mentions using his own stock, which is very weak and without salt.\n 2: Strengthen the stock by adding a bit of chicken base, preferably an organic one, or use regular chicken stock.\n 3: Season the stock with salt and pepper to taste, keeping in mind that Jacques uses about 6 cups of stock.\n 4: Trim and chop scallions and chives, then add them to the stock.\n 5: Bring the stock to a boil and add about a cup (or 2 ounces) of vermicelli noodles.\n 6: Let the soup boil for 4 to 5 minutes until the vermicelli is cooked.\n 7: Optionally, add Swiss cheese such as Jarlsberg, Emmentaler, or Gruyere to the soup for extra flavor.\n 8: Serve the soup hot, with additional gruyere cheese if desired, and enjoy.\n\nThe dish is a simple sauted spinach with garlic, seasoned with salt and pepper, and finished with a touch of butter.
